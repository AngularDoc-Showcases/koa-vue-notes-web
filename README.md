# Laravel-Vue-Notes-Web Project

This is a SPA using Laravel (5.4) for the backend and Vue (2.3) for the frontend. There's more to this, but it is currently still in progress. You're welcome to take a look around as I get things set up.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
